 With the massive growth and widespread usage of social media platforms, the rates of its misuse and its corresponding impact on society have seen an exponential rise in numbers. The comfort of anonymity and wide reach offered by social media has led to the convenient spread of hatred and incitement to threats, that are often targeted against particular users and communities. Thus identifying hate speech, threats and intense emotions in the digital arena has gained attention recently. This is also the aim of the EmoThreat: Emotions and Threat Detection in Urdu 2022 Challenge. In this paper, we describe a few traditional machine learning models and deep neural networks submitted by our team Aces for Task A: Multi-label emotion classification in Urdu. The models tested include Classifier Chains, MLKNN, RNN and LSTM Networks implemented with a combination of feature extraction methods such as the Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF, as well as embedding models like Word2Vec and FastText.
